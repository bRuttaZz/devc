**The initial version of *devc*, with its primary features.**

The good news is, if you're on Linux, you can give **devc** a try. It's a streamlined container tool designed for developers working on local development. It's compatible with contemporary container standards like Docker and OCI. **devc** facilitates you with a python-virtual-environment kind of way to interact with your container environments.
